INTRODUCTION)
Albhedroid is a simple substitution cipherer for Google Android, 
preloaded with the Al Bhed cipher of Squaresoft RPG fame. This 
is my very first Android app. I've made it a practice to 
re-implement this app the first thing I do whenever I'm learning 
a new language or platform. The reason is that it's fairly easy 
to do, but still involves common UI programming, event handling
and string transformation. In other words, it's a bit more 
interesting than a simple "Hello, world!".

USAGE)
Just launch the app, type some text into the topmost box and 
click go. If you want some parts of the text to be ignored by 
the cipherer, enclose it in curly brackets ("{}"). Just make 
sure that they are correctly matched and not nested, or 
otherwise the cipherer will get angry.
